* Research Fellow

* University of St Andrews

I am a Research Fellow in the AI group at the University of St Andrews.  My main research focus lies in Automated Planning, which is a central discipline of Artificial Intelligence. This area studies decision-making in a given environment to reach or optimise a goal.  These problems are ubiquitous in industry and science, where they appear in logistics, chemistry or even network security, just to name a few. More concretely, my published work mainly lies in the intersection of Automated Planning, Constraint Satisfaction, Reformulation and applications of logic in computer science.
