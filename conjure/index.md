# Conjure

Conjure is an Automated Constraint Modelling tool, which accepts  problems specified in the Essence language and outputs constraint models in the language Essence', suitable for input to our tool Savile Row, which then tailors these models to the input requirements of particular constraint solvers.
Conjure's source code repository and <a href="https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure/releases">release versions</a> are hosted on <a href="https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure">Github</a>, where we also welcome bug reports, feature requests and pull requests.
